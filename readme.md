# Boris Bikes App
Boris Bikes will provide rental bikes across London.  Bikes can be checked out of and in at docking stations. The app keeps track of docking stations and bikes.

## Motivation
We're building this as a project on week 1 of Makers. This will help us to achieve the following goals:
*I write code that is easy to change
*I can test-drive my code
*I can build with objects
*I know how my language works
